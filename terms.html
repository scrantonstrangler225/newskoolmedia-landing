  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p>Last updated: September 1, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the New Skool Media platform, which enables athletes, podcasters, content creators, and sports organizations
    to upload, distribute, monetize, and manage sports media. This includes behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, podcasts, training content, and league-authorized materials.
    By using the New Skool Media service ("Service"), you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Beta Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    New Skool Media is currently in beta. Features and functionality may evolve as we continue to build and improve the platform.
    Updates will be made with care to protect content integrity, media rights, and a high-quality user experience for creators and league partners.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Content Ownership & NIL (Name, Image, Likeness)</h2>
  <p>
    You retain full ownership of all content you upload, including audio, video, images, and performance data. By uploading content to New Skool Media,
    you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, host, stream, display, and distribute your content for platform functionality,
    discovery, analytics, and promotional purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    New Skool Media supports lawful monetization of athlete content under applicable Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) regulations. Users are responsible for complying
    with institutional, league, or state-level NIL policies where relevant. Monetization tools (e.g., tipping, licensing, brand sponsorship integrations)
    are provided to support athlete and creator success.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Underage Athletes</h2>
  <p>
    If you upload content featuring individuals under the age of 18, you must obtain the necessary parental or legal guardian consent before submission.
    This applies to any media that includes underage athletes’ name, image, voice, or likeness. New Skool Media may request verification of such consent
    and reserves the right to remove content that does not meet these requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    We take the privacy and safety of minors seriously. New Skool Media implements safeguards to prevent the unauthorized commercial use of minor content
    and complies with applicable child protection and privacy laws (such as COPPA in the U.S.).
  </p>

  <h2>5. Content Guidelines & User Conduct</h2>
  <p>
    You agree not to upload or share any content that is unlawful, infringing, defamatory, hateful, violent, or misleading.
    You may not impersonate others, submit false information, or misuse the platform for harassment, spam, or manipulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are responsible for ensuring you have appropriate rights and permissions for all media uploaded, including third-party music,
    logos, uniforms, or branded content visible in your footage.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property & Platform Rights</h2>
  <p>
    All technology, design, branding, and user interface elements of the New Skool Media platform are owned by New Skool Media Inc.
    You may not reverse-engineer, reproduce, or redistribute any part of the platform without prior written authorization.
  </p>

  <h2>7. League & Partner Agreements</h2>
  <p>
    New Skool Media works with schools, leagues (e.g., MLB, NCAA, ICC), broadcasters, and teams to manage content permissions and publishing rights.
    If your content is governed by a third-party agreement (e.g., team contract, league license), you are responsible for adhering to those terms.
    Violation of third-party policies may result in content removal or account restriction.
  </p>

  <h2>8. DMCA & Copyright</h2>
  <p>
    New Skool Media respects intellectual property laws and complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
    If you believe your copyrighted work has been used inappropriately on our platform, you may file a takedown request by emailing:
    <a href="mailto:innovation@newskoolmedia.world">Contact Us</a>. Please include your name, contact info, a description of the copyrighted work,
    the infringing content’s location, and a statement under penalty of perjury that your claim is accurate.
  </p>
  <p>
    New Skool Media reserves the right to remove content in response to valid DMCA notices and to terminate repeat infringers.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Platform Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may modify or update the Service at any time to improve user experience, ensure compliance, or expand features.
    We will notify users of major changes when possible, particularly those affecting access, monetization, or visibility of your content.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    New Skool Media reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the platform at our discretion, especially in cases of policy violation,
    copyright infringement, abusive behavior, or content that harms the safety or reputation of other users or the platform.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms may be updated periodically. You will be notified of material changes via email or in-platform alerts.
    Continued use of the platform after changes are posted indicates your acceptance of the revised Terms.
